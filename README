== Saint

This is an Ruby on Rails application used by Salesforce.com to enhance our
Omniture SiteCatalyst implementation. It uses the Omniture REST API to pull
unclassified traffic source data, classify them based on a set of company-
defined rules, and then push the classified data back into SiteCatalyst.

Using this application allows the following:

- Users can add new websites to be classified.
- Users can add rules for how search keywords will be classified as branded
  or non-branded, and for which Salesforce product they are associated with.
- The classification script can be run.
